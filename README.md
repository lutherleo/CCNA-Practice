# CCNA Lab Practice 📘

This repository is a collection of labs I’ve worked on while studying for the **CCNA (Cisco Certified Network Associate)** exam.

It's mainly here to help me **keep track of my progress**, revisit old configurations, and organize everything I’ve practiced so far.

## 🧪 What’s Inside

- Labs covering key CCNA topics (VLANs, routing, NAT, ACLs, etc.)
- Packet Tracer files (`.pkt`)
- Config files and notes (`.txt` / `.md`)
- Random troubleshooting setups I used for practice

## 📌 Why This Repo?

Just a personal archive of all the hands-on labs I’ve done during my prep.  
Nothing fancy — just me learning, breaking stuff, and fixing it again.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- A lot of `show` and `debug` commands :)
